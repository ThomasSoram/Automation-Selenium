#Automated Login Test for Facebook using Selenium WebDriver

 #Description:
We developed an automated test script to verify Facebook login functionality using Selenium WebDriver and Java. The project involved setting up the Selenium WebDriver environment, writing automated test cases, and validating the login process through browser automation.

#Key Responsibilities:
Configured the Selenium WebDriver with the Chrome browser for automation testing.
Designed and implemented an automation script in Java to perform the following tasks:
Navigate to the Facebook login page.
Maximize the browser window for better visibility and interaction.
Locate and interact with the email and password input fields using By.name.
Simulate user input by entering a sample username and password.
Trigger the login action by clicking the login button.
Retrieve and verify the page title post-login to ensure the test accuracy.
Implemented exception handling to manage potential errors and ensure the script's robustness.
Utilized the quit() method to close the browser session gracefully after the test execution.
